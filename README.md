# Weather-Dashboard-DU-CBC

## Description

The following project is to demonstrate my understanding of Bootstrap and jquery, combined with everything else we have learned up to this point to create a weather dashboard. Motivation behind this was to access APIs from the web and connect and grab information from it and display it on our application. We built these to get a better understaing of APIs and how other applications and websites are able to display different kinds of information.

## Installation

All that is needed to run this program is a current version of visual code studios

## Usage

when the page loads enter the city you would like to know the weather for and the application will display it as well as a 5 day forcast of the weather for you. if you wish to enter another city simply repet the first step and the new city will display from there. if you wish to go back to a previous city, no need to type it out again click on the butttons generating the previous weather.

attached are links for how the app should run and look
